# Self_Drive_Learning_Car_Simulation
a simulation of a self-driving car implemented using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm and the Pygame library. The simulation aims to replicate real-world driving scenarios and evaluate the performance of the self-driving car in terms of navigation, obstacle avoidance, and overall driving proficiency.
